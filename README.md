# RLUtilities
RLBot Functions and Classes made for ease of use and with detailed descriptions.

# Goals
The goals of RLUtilities is to make bot development easier for all.

# How is This Done?
The way RLUtilities does this is by supplying botmakers with several functions and classes. Some of these are for preprocessing and storing data in a better format, others are for actions the bot can do like dodging and wavedashing, and providing them with usefull tools they can use.


# Why is This Usefull?
I believe this will make starting to program bots much easier, especially for beginners. They won't have to worry about preprocessing or data storage as it's the same for everyone, just small differences depending on personal preference.
    Along with that, actions like dodging are just bot makers trying to make the best and most efficient mechanics. That is the reason I believe making code like this open source provides beginners with the tools they need to start compeeting with the leaders.
    This will make bot making more about strategi and tactics, than good mechanics. You will on the other hand still have a competitive advantage when discovering something new. That is untill someone else figures it out and submitts it here ;)

# Getting Started
Currently the only way to get the code is by either cloning the project or prefferably, going into the files and using copy paste.

I try to supply as much information in the code as possible, but a better README is comming soon...
